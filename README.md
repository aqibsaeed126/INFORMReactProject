# Exercise Instructions

The goal of the exercise is to list and format breweries contained in the [Open Brewery DB](https://www.openbrewerydb.org/).

The tasks to be performed are as follows:

1. Fetch the data using the list functionality of the API (`https://api.openbrewerydb.org/breweries`).
   Note that, by default, there is a limit of 20 breweries per response, that is fine.
2. Display the retrieved data in a list and make it pretty
3. Implement a search functionality to lookup for specific breweries
4. Implement a sorting functionality to sort the list by name or by type of brewery

The preferred language is [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and the front-end frame work which should
be use is [React](https://reactjs.org/).
If you wish, you can use a component libraries like [MUI](https://mui.com/), [Lodash](https://lodash.com/) etc.

As a starting point for solving the exercise [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) can be used.
To quickly setup a React Typescript project type command:

```
npx create-react-app my-exercise-app --template typescript
```
